# Free.ky Demo
Very early DEMO for my Freaky "Freeky" project.
Its a new interpreter, that is designed for lazy ass people (kidding :)
But it has a very short and simple syntax
It uses special characters instead of keywords and built-in functions
(Syntaxes and more info. will be added.)
(To be continued...)
