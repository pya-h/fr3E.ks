## Fr3ek Language
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are different implementations of my cute little language 'fr3ek', which ive stopped continuing them unfortunately -Each for a specific reason- And now Im implementing it using go, which that repo is also added here as submodule.


## Idea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may ask, what the fuck Im doing, writing a project over and over again?
Well, I don't have the slightest clue either.
Anyhow, Here is my journey:
<hr />

## Fr3eky (Python)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all started -nearly 7-8 years ago with a funny a little idea, to write a fast symbolic programming language, for lazy ass programmers :)
I think i had learned python just then and Decided to do a project to review everything. I really wasn't looking for anything meaningful, I was just looking for amusement.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the after a while, I realized I had put to much time on it, and then I though 'Why Not?' and started thinking on its full syntax and grammars.
But there was a problem; It was started as a hobby and It had so many structural problems.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started revising and fixing all those problems, and while doing it, a serious thought was irritating me: An interpreter Implemented by An interpreter?
Anyhow, I continue implementing the language, fixed most of the problems and implemented many sections; At that stage, Fr3eky had Expressions, Variables, Arrays, Conditions, Loops (one layer loops though), Complete math support, even some cool features such as the option to define Math Function (Independent from Normal Functions), Drafting (You could save a calculation result in memory and use it in future), etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then everything became too complicated (due to the old structural problems); And also The irritating thought started overcoming my will.

## Fr3e.ks! (Node.ts)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left the python project as it was for a while. But the thought and enthusiasm stay with me. I wasn't looking for anything special, I even knew that no idiot
will even possibly think about using such a language; I just wanted to do this, Just for the fun of it, And also extending my skills.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this time I started developing with a faster language; And this time since I knew what I want, I designed the structure carefully.
Just right after implementing the basics, The old irritating thought started fucking with my head; The I said fuck it. Let's do this properly, once and for all.

## Fr3e.c
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned to my Love: C(++); I started defining everything and all happily. But each step further, It was becoming harder and harder; Even to think about what should I do. Here it worth mentioning, All this time I didn't have the first clue about creating a Interpreter :)) I was just doing it by intuition all the way.
Then I said why I should fuck my brain, for a project only meant to be a hobby? Why not using a simpler language like go? It's as proper as writing it with C++, but way easier. (You may think Im too-fucking-much of a overthinker, You're absolutely right.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I modified the code a little, converting it to be a large number calculator, so it may be less embarrassing for me this time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im developing this idea with golang now; I'm at the beginning though, but this is the last decision change :)
Also, this time I said Fuck you to my intuitions, and started reading the 'Crafting Interpreters' book, to this the best way I could, once and for all.
